// Kotlin allows us to add functions to an existing class by prefixing the
// function name with the type it's extending.

// You can refer to the instance the extension is called on (the "receiver")
// with the usual 'this' keyword.

fun String.shuffled() = this.toList().shuffled().joinToString(separator = "")

// This is handy for adding things to the stdlib or other libraries that you
// feel are missing.

fun String.bedazzled() = "***$this***"

fun main() {

	val shuffled = "Alphabet".shuffled()

	println("Alphabet.shuffled(): $shuffled")

	val bedazzled = "Snazzy".bedazzled()

	println("Snazzy.bedazzled(): $bedazzled")

	// Extension functions are resolved statically by the receiver's
	// declared or inferred type. In other words, they are not polymorphic.

	class Lion : Animal()
