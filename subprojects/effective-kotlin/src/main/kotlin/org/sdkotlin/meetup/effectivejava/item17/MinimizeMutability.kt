/* Effective Java
Item 17: Minimize mutability
 */

// In Kotlin, immutability is just a `val` away.

const val FUGGETABOUTIT = "Not gonna do it"

data class ThreadSafe(val readOnly: String = "Can't touch this") {

	fun immutable(): String {
		val value = "Don't even"
		// value += "Nope" // Doesn't compile
		return value

// The base collection APIs are immutable by default in Kotlin.

val immutableList = listOf("Not", "gonna", "do", "it", "!")

fun main() {

	//FUGGETABOUTIT = "As if" // Doesn't compile
	println(FUGGETABOUTIT)

	val threadSafe = ThreadSafe()
	// threadSafe.readOnly = "Sorry" // Doesn't compile
	println(threadSafe.readOnly)
	println(threadSafe.immutable())

	//immutableList[0] = "Are" // Does not compile.

	println(immutableList)
